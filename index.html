                    My great grandmother, Etelvina, passed away in 2013. During my most recent visit to Colombia, I saw this picture of my cousin being held by her. It brought out feelings of longing and guilt. The time I  visited prior was 2010. She was still alive but I was still a begrudging teen. Reflecting on it now is painful, I wish I'd appreciated having the privilege to have lived so long with this family member around and realized how much she'd done for me and documented us together in some way.

                        If I could have a photo of us together. It'd be during that 2010 visit and it'd feature me, my sister and my great grandmother in the home that she purchased to raise my grandfather and his siblings. I'm standing to her right, in between her and my sister who is still firmly in her childhood. I'd tower over the both of them, as I do with the rest of my family to this day.  
                        It's the early afternoon with the sun coming into the living room, blasting the white tiles and walls with photos of my family hanging on it. The space is furnished with a motley of chairs, one upholstered, another wooden and a final one plastic. My sister and great-grandmother are smiling and I'm scowling as a way to defy my dad for making me take this picture.

                        While the idea of this photo fills me with emotion, happiness in fantasy, sadness in the reality. Making the picture to get rid of the latter, would not bring me more of the former as while the picture is not real, the pain of not having it is. That pain hurts but that pain is necessary. It creates the balance for joy. It shows me while the past and the future are linked, they do not have to be the same.

                        In digging deeper into the pain for this, I remember the words of my mentor, Kathleen Sleboda who is Nlaka'pamux who told me that knowing one's ancestors is a lifelong journey. My relationship with my great-grandmother and all my past ancestors extends beyond the photos I have of them. I can feel connected when I wear my braids, when I eat the food that they supported their children making and through preserving to reach my goals with my family in mind, just like she did when she purchased that home for my grandfather. I am a part of her as she is a part of me and nothing, including a photo not taken, can ever take that away.
